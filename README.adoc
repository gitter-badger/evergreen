Evergreen is an automatically updating rolling distribution system for
"<<essentials>>." It consists of server-side, and client-side components to
support a Chrome-like upgrade experience for Jenkins users.

== Design Documents

Evergreen and Jenkins Essentials are both captured in the following design
documents:

== Jenkins Essentials
Jenkins Essentials provides the end-user with a
pre-assembled collection of legos that can be immediately used to implement CI
footnoteref:[ci, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration]
and CD
footnoteref:[cd, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery] workloads.
At the same time, this focus on end-users success in these well-defined scenarios
will help the Jenkins project develop new features, and fix
bugs, more rapidly than before.


== Hacking

Backend services are written in Ruby, while the client-side is a mix of
standard Jenkins components and Node.js.

Everything should be easily executed via some Docker tooling behind `make`. To
run tests for example, simply run `make check` in the root directory of this
repository.

=== The Four Opens

Inspired by the Openstack project
footnote:[https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/opens.html]
Jenkins Essentials follows "The Four Opens":

==== Open Source

We do _not_ produce “open core” software.

We are committed to creating truly open source software that is usable and
scalable. Truly open source software is not feature or performance limited and
is not crippled.


We use the MIT license.



==== Open Design

*We are committed to an open design process.*  The development cycle requires
active collaboration to gather requirements and write specifications for
upcoming releases. Those events, which are *open to anyone,* include users,
developers, and upstream projects. We gather requirements, define priorities
and flesh out technical design to guide development for the next development
cycle.

The community controls the design process. You can help make this software meet
your needs.

==== Open Development

We maintain a publicly available source code repository through the entire
development process. We do public code reviews. We have public roadmaps. This
makes participation simpler, allows users to follow the development process and
participate in QA at an early stage.

==== Open Community

One of our core goals is to maintain a healthy, vibrant developer and user
community. Most decisions are made using a lazy consensus model. All processes
are documented, open and transparent.
